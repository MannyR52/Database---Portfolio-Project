Project Overview

The Winery Database Management System is a web-based application built with Flask, Python, MySQL, HTML, and CSS to help administrators efficiently manage winery data. It enables Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a structured database while ensuring data integrity through many-to-many relationships, cascading deletions, and nullable foreign keys.

    MySQL Database Integration: Structured relational schema with at least four entities and relationships, including a many-to-many relationship.
    Full CRUD Functionality: Enables adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving records.
    Dynamic Drop-down & Search: Users can select foreign keys without manual ID entry.
    Data Integrity & Constraints: Prevents anomalies with cascading deletes and nullable foreign keys.
    User-Friendly Interface: Simple HTML & CSS frontend for managing winery data.
